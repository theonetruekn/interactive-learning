      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating within Jinja2 templates. The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",

The problem doesn't seem to lie directly with the configuration but rather how you've structured your SQL template code using Jinja2 syntax for loop rendering without new lines between columns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that `sqlfluff` is designed to work well with Jinja2 and can handle complex templating, including loops over a list of column names, it seems like the solution should be straightforward but might require adjusting how you're trying to combine Jinja2 syntax with SQL structure. Your approach using a loop in Jinja2 looks mostly correct for generating the part of the query that selects multiple columns dynamically.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, since `sqlfluff` is throwing an exception indicating \"Position Not Found,\" it might be worth double-checking whether there are any specific rules or configurations within your setup (`[sqlfluff:rules]` section) that could potentially conflict with your templating approach but weren't immediately apparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a slightly adjusted version of your Jinja2 template code for clarity and to ensure it adheres closely to best practices, though the primary issue might still stem from how `sqlfluff` handles this specific combination of templating and SQL formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted = [{'name': 'COL_1'}, {'name': 'COL_2'}, {'name': 'COL_3'}] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{# Render columns separated by commas, ensuring the last item has no comma #}\n",
      "{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{ col.name }}\n",
      "{% if not loop.last %}, {% endif %}\n",
      "{%- else -%}{{ whitelisted[0].name }}{% endif %}\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT\n",
      "    {{ ''.join([col.name for col in whitelisted]) }}\n",
      "FROM SOME_TABLE;\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This version ensures that all column names are correctly concatenated into a single string, and the `SELECT` statement is properly formatted with indentation according to standard SQL syntax. Note how we handle the last item differently by checking if it's the loop's last iteration using `loop.last`. Also, adjusting the final rendering of columns for clarity; however, based on your description, this should still maintain compatibility with `sqlfluff`'s expectations and configurations you've provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "If after these adjustments the issue persists, it might be worth exploring more about `sqlfluff`'s specific rules that could affect templating-related SQL syntax or seeking clarification from the sqlfluff GitHub repository or community forums on handling this exact scenario with Jinja2 templates and Snowflake dialect. \n",
