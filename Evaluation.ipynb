      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",

      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",

      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`).

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",
      "templater = jinja\n",
      "\n",
      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",

      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",

      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",

      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`).

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " To address the issue you're facing with `sqlfluff` not passing the lint and fix, it seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a misconfiguration in your setup for handling SQL templating with Jinja2 that results in an exception when trying to render your query. The approach you've taken by removing newlines between selected columns should generally work, but let's ensure we follow best practices and verify configurations to resolve the issue effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given your configuration and requirements, here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the issue:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Verify Jinja2 Configuration\n",
      "Ensure that your Jinja2 templating is correctly configured in `sqlfluff`. Your current setup seems appropriate for handling SQL templates with Jinja2 syntax, but let's ensure it aligns perfectly with your needs. The configuration you provided doesn't seem to have any direct issues based on the exception message you received. However, double-checking configurations can help:\n",
      "\n",
      "```ini\n",
      "[sqlfluff]\n",
      "# Existing settings are correct for handling Jinja2 templates\n",

      "[sqlfluff:rules]\n",
      "# Ensure this section doesn't conflict with your templating needs\n",
      "extended_capitalisation_policy = upper  # This is more about styling and less likely to cause issues.\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Review the SQL Template Syntax Again\n",
      "Re-examine your Jinja2 template syntax to ensure it aligns well with what `sqlfluff` expects, especially since you're using a new format for specifying columns:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Ensure that column names are correctly formatted within the loop and properly concatenated. You might want to add an underscore (`_`) after each name except when it ends the line to align more closely with standard SQL conventions (e.g., `COL_1`, `COL_2`, `COL_3`). This minor adjustment can sometimes help avoid unexpected behavior:\n",
      "\n",
      "```jinja\n",
      "{% set whitelisted= [\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_1'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_2'},\n",
      "    {'name': 'COL_3'}\n",
      "] %}\n",
      "\n",
      "{% set some_part_of_the_query %}{% for col in whitelisted -%}\n",
      "{{col.name}}_{{ loop.index if not loop.last else ''}}{{ \", \" }}\n",
      "{% endfor %}{{ loop.first ? \"\" : \",\" }}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Confirm Snowflake-Specific Settings\n",
      "Since you're working with a Snowflake dialect, ensure that `sqlfluff` is correctly configured for it:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Dialect Configuration**: Verify if there are any specific configurations or known issues related to Snowflake in the `sqlfluff` documentation. Sometimes, certain behavior might be expected based on the database system's idiosyncrasies.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 4. Investigate Further with Debugging Outputs\n",
      "Since you have access to both linting and fix outputs, use these tools to further investigate what happens during execution:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Lint Only**: Run `sqlfluff linter` without attempting the fix to see if there are any issues that only arise during linting. This can help isolate syntax or formatting issues in your templates.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Fix Outputs**: After running `sqlfluff fix`, check the output thoroughly against your expected query format. Any discrepancies here might highlight areas where adjustments are necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Submit a Pull Request (PR) if Needed\n",
      "If after these steps you still encounter issues, consider submitting an issue on the `sqlfluff` GitHub repository with details about your problem and what you've tried so far. This way, contributors or maintainers can assist further in addressing any unforeseen bugs or configuration errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "By carefully reviewing each step above, you should be able to identify if there's a specific issue within your setup that `sqlfluff` is encountering and take appropriate actions to resolve it. Remember, collaboration with the community can often provide the most effective solutions for these kinds of issues. \n",
