This can guide me towards understanding if the desired functionality exists within SQLFluff itself or through an alternative method like a wrapper script.The specified path is not a file: repos/sqlfluff(Current Working Directory: repos) Thought: To find information on SQLFluff's CLI verbosity settings, I should search for documentation or community discussions that may reveal whether such functionality exists within SQLFluff itself or if an alternative method like creating a wrapper script is necessary.The specified path is not a file: repos/sqlfluff(Current Working Directory: repos) Thought: Since direct exploration of the `sqlfluff` directory did not yield results, I'll search online for SQLFluff documentation or community discussions that might mention how to adjust CLI verbosity levels.

Therefore, listing all classes and their methods from this file would be the most appropriate action.\\n\\nAction: List_Classes[\\'test.py\\']\\n\\nObservation: The classes in test.py are `MyClass` with docstring `No docstring provided`, `MyClass2` with docstring `No docstring provided`.\\n(Current Working Directory: test_codebase)\\n Thought: Now that I have the list of classes from \\'test.py\\', I need to find out which methods are available for each class, specifically focusing on `MyClass` and `MyClass2`, as they were identified in the previous observation. Listing the methods of these classes is the best course of action.\\n\\nAction: List_Methods[\\'MyClass\\']\\n\\nObservation: Method __init__(self, one, two) with docstring { Init the class. Careful: do not touch! }, Method do_stuff(self) with docstring { None }\\n(Current Working Directory: test_codebase)\\n Thought: With the methods of `MyClass` listed, I should now list the methods for `MyClass2`. This will complete my task and provide a comprehensive answer to the question.\\n\\nAction: List_Methods[\\'MyClass2\\']\\n\\nObservation: Method another_way_to_do_stuff(self, i) with docstring { None }\\n(Current Working Directory: test_codebase)\\n Thought: Now that I have listed the methods for both `MyClass` and `MyClass2`, I can provide a comprehensive answer to the question.\\n\\nAction: Finish[\"The classes in test.py have the following methods:\" + \", \".join(method for class_name, method in [(\\'MyClass\\', \\'__init__(self, one, two)\\'), (\\'MyClass\\', \\'do_stuff(self)\\'), (\\'MyClass2\\', \\'another_way_to_do_stuff(self, i)\\')])]\\n\\nObservation: The classes in test.py have the following methods:\" + ,\".join(method for class_name,method in [(\\'MyClass\\',\\'__init__(self,one,two)\\'),(\\'MyClass\\',\\'do_stuff(self)\\'),(\\'MyClass2\\',\\'another_way_to_do_stuff(self,i)\\')])'"
